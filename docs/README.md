# OctoAcme Project Management Documentation

Welcome to the OctoAcme Project Management Process Documentation. This README serves as the central entry point for understanding how OctoAcme manages projects—from initiation through planning, execution, release, and continuous improvement. These docs are designed to centralize institutional knowledge, standardize workflows across teams, and provide consistent guidance for all project stakeholders.

## Overview of OctoAcme Project Management Processes

OctoAcme follows a customer-first, iterative approach to project delivery. Each project moves through a structured lifecycle with clearly defined roles, artifacts, and communication cadences to ensure transparency and successful outcomes. Our process is built on five core principles: prioritizing customer value and usability, delivering small testable increments, maintaining clear ownership with named Project Managers and Product Leads, making data-informed decisions, and fostering psychological safety to encourage feedback and learning.

The project lifecycle consists of five key phases. **Initiation** validates the business need through a Project One-pager that defines the problem, goals, success metrics, stakeholders, and initial timeline. **Planning** breaks approved initiatives into actionable backlogs with acceptance criteria, estimates, risk assessments, and release plans. **Execution and Tracking** manages day-to-day delivery using project boards, pull request workflows, quality assurance practices (including unit tests, integration tests, CI security scanning, and manual QA), and regular standups, demos, and reviews. **Release and Deployment** standardizes how features reach production through pre-release requirements, deployment checklists, smoke tests, and rollback plans. Finally, **Retrospective and Continuous Improvement** captures learnings after each sprint, release, or milestone to drive actionable improvements.

Our teams are organized around clear roles and responsibilities. **Project Managers** coordinate delivery, schedules, risks, and communications. **Product Managers** define outcomes, prioritize the backlog, and measure success. **Scrum Masters** facilitate agile ceremonies, remove impediments, and coach teams on agile practices. **Developers** implement features and collaborate on design and testability. **UX Designers** create user-centered designs, conduct research, and validate solutions. **QA/Testing** validates quality and acceptance criteria. **Release Managers** coordinate releases, manage deployments, and ensure release readiness. **Security Leads** ensure security integration, identify vulnerabilities, and guide secure practices. **Stakeholders** provide inputs and approvals. Communication flows through weekly syncs between PM and Product Manager, twice-weekly standups for delivery teams, monthly stakeholder updates, and ad-hoc escalations as needed.

Key artifacts maintained throughout the project include the Project Charter or One-pager, Roadmap and Release Plan, Sprint/Iteration Backlog, Acceptance Criteria and Definition of Done, Risk Register, and Retrospective notes with action items. Together, these processes and practices ensure that OctoAcme delivers high-quality products efficiently while continuously learning and improving.
